        <div id="ratioText">The current ratio is a liquidity ratio that measures a companys ability to pay short-term
            obligations or those due within one year. It tells investors and analysts how a company can maximize the
            current assets on its balance sheet to satisfy its current debt and other payables. A current ratio that is
            in line with the industry average or slightly higher is generally considered acceptable. A current ratio
            that is lower than the industry average may indicate a higher risk of distress or default. Similarly, if a
            company has a very high current ratio compared with its peer group, it indicates that management may not be
            using its assets efficiently.</div>
